cd <repo>
npm install
npm run dev
```
Add a short demo GIF or link at the top of each project README to increase engagement.

## Profile improvements checklist (quick wins)
- Add 1–2 demo GIFs or screenshots to each project README and portfolio.  
- Add 1–2 impact metrics per project (e.g., reduced TTFB by X%, or “used by X users”).  
- Add LICENSE (MIT) to repos you want others to reuse.  
- Add GitHub Actions CI with test & lint checks and show badges in READMEs.  
- Add topics to repos (nextjs, react, typescript, tailwindcss, redux).  
- Keep READMEs short: TL;DR, quick start (2–3 commands), usage, demo link, contact.

---

If you want, I can:
- Replace the placeholder repo descriptions above with polished, copy‑ready descriptions containing metrics/screenshots if you paste the project READMEs or give me one repo to start with.  
- Generate full README content (with badges, demo GIF markdown, CI badge, and a 2‑command quick start) for any single repo you pick.  
- Create concise pin descriptions and a reworded bio for your profile header.

Which repo should I generate a full README for first? (I recommend starting with the E‑Commerce Platform or ai‑tools‑directory.)
